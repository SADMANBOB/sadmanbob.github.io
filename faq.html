        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        <h3>How long does an inspection take?</h3>
        <p>Most single‑family homes take two to three hours. Larger properties or homes with attics or crawlspaces may take longer.</p>
        <h3>When will I get the report?</h3>
        <p>You’ll get a same‑day PDF via email with photos and clear recommendations.</p>
        <h3>Do you do termite or radon testing?</h3>
        <p>We offer radon testing as an add‑on. For WDI/termite inspections we can refer a trusted partner.</p>

        <h3>Do you offer rush reports or evening inspections?</h3>
